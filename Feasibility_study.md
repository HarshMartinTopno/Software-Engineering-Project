# Feasibility Study

## 1. Technical Feasibility

### Technology Stack
- **OCR**: Readily available open-source (Tesseract) or commercial APIs (Google Vision, AWS Textract).  
- **LLM Integration**: Cloud-hosted models (OpenAI, Anthropic) can handle semantic evaluation of subjective answers.  
- **Frontend & Backend**: Standard web technologies (React/Angular + Node.js/Django + database).  

**Complexity**: Medium. OCR for handwritten text can be error-prone but manageable with preprocessing. LLM-based grading aligns well with current AI capabilities.  

### Infrastructure
- Cloud hosting recommended initially.  
- Scalable microservices architecture possible for future growth.  

**Risk Factors**:  
- OCR accuracy with poor handwriting.  
- Dependence on internet/cloud LLM APIs.  
- Handling bias or inconsistency in LLM grading.  

**Feasibility Verdict**: ✅ Technically feasible with current AI and cloud tools.

## 2. Resource Feasibility

### Human Resources
- 1 AI/ML engineers (OCR & LLM integration).  
- 1 backend developer, 1 frontend developer.  
- 1 QA tester.  
- 1 project manager.  

### Hardware/Software Resources
- **Development**: Mid-range servers or cloud environments.  
- **Deployment**: Cloud hosting (AWS, GCP, Azure) with LLM API integration.  

**Timeframe**: MVP can be developed in **4–6 months** with a small agile team.  

**Feasibility Verdict**: ✅ Resource feasible if budget supports small development team and API costs.

## 3. Market Feasibility

### Target Market
Schools, colleges, and coaching institutes needing faster exam evaluation.  

### Market Demand
High—manual evaluation is time-consuming; institutions are increasingly adopting EdTech automation.  

### Competitive Landscape
Few direct competitors focusing on handwritten exam evaluation. Most existing solutions emphasize online/MCQ-based exams.  

### Differentiator
Focus on handwritten, subjective answers with semantic AI-based grading.  

### Adoption Barriers
Resistance from teachers concerned about accuracy; need for trust-building and explainable grading.  

**Feasibility Verdict**: ✅ Market feasible with strong differentiation and rising digital adoption in education.

## 4. Economic Feasibility

### Development Costs
- Small-team salaries or outsourcing (**approx. $50k–100k** for MVP).  
- Cloud API usage costs (OCR + LLM) depending on scale.  

### Operational Costs
- Hosting and API calls (scalable with usage).  
- Maintenance and updates.  

### Revenue Model Options
- Subscription-based pricing for institutions.  
- Pay-per-batch evaluation (volume-based pricing).  

### Return on Investment
- Strong potential—time savings for educators and reduced workload.  
- Break-even possible in **1–2 years** with modest adoption by schools/coaching centers.  

**Feasibility Verdict**: ✅ Economically feasible with scalable SaaS model.
